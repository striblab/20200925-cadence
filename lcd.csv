      <p>Two weeks into Minnesota’s early voting for November’s general election, more than 75,000 mail ballots have been accepted – and over a million requested – even as worries over voting security escalate among lawmakers, advocates and voters.</p>

      <p>But this pandemic year is Minnesota’s largest mail voting operation to date, and data from the state’s primary in August reveal more Minnesotans returned their ballots than prior elections, while smaller portions of votes arrived late or were otherwise rejected.</p>

      <p>More than a half million Minnesotans <a href=""https://www.startribune.com/6-of-10-minnesota-primary-voters-cast-ballots-absentee-or-by-mail/568966771/#comment"">voted early in the state primary</a>, accounting for nearly two-thirds of total ballots and tripling turnout. And despite concerns over United States Postal Service delays, most of those votes arrived before Primary Day, while about 8 percent were counted during this year’s two-day extension window.</p>

        <p>And of the 555,400 mail ballots returned by voters, around 4,500 were rejected for arriving too late – less than 1 percent.</p>

        <p>Overall, a slightly lower portion of early primary ballots were rejected this year, the most common reasons listed being problems with signatures, dates or other issues properly filling things out.</p>

    <section class=""container-lg body"">
        <p>Only 80 ballots were rejected because the individual already voted, and only 10 rejections were due to the voter dying. About 8,000 ballots sent to voters were replacements for lost or spoiled ballots.</p>

        <p>While about a third of requested ballots sent to Minnesotans weren’t returned to election officials, that’s roughly the same non-return rate as in 2018’s primary. And not all of those are squandered voting opportunities, as some people simply request ballots and then either don’t vote, vote early in-person or wait for Election Day instead.</p>

    <section class=""container-lg body"">
        <p>Critics, including President Donald Trump, have publicly doubted the safety and validity of mail voting, while others have questioned the beleaguered Postal Service’s abilities to handle influxes of ballot requests and returns in a timely fashion.</p>

        <p>While the winners of Minnesota's major primary races were clear on results night without delayed ballots tipping the scales, observers have warned uncertainty over the outcomes of November's contests may linger past Election Day.</p>
